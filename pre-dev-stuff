Making a copy of your files and database
Moving them to the new server
Updating references in the database that refer to its old location
Changing the values in wp-config.php to fit the new environment




1) using phpmyadmin -export database
2) open C9 and create new wordpress template
3) edit wp-congif to refeltct backuped database login
in c9 terminal make sure sql is installed -> 
mysql-ctl install
Then install phpMyAdmin:
phpmyadmin-ctl install ->here you get the login and url for phomyadmin eg: https://dev1-tolkadot.c9users.io/phpmyadmin
After the installation is complete you'll just want to make sure mysql is running once more:
mysql-ctl start

4)  open the .sql backup .
Find and replace all the instances of your old URL with your new URL. 
For instance if your blog address is at http://example.com/wordpress/, and your files 
on your computer are at /htdocs/wordpress/, replace it with http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/.
SAVE

4) open phpmyadmin and import the backedup database
