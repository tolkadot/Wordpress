Making a copy of your files and database
Moving them to the new server
Updating references in the database that refer to its old location
Changing the values in wp-config.php to fit the new environment


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) using phpmyadmin -export database

Under databases tab -> select the database 
select the export tab 
custom - >tables - >select all
Add DROP TABLE / VIEW / PROCEDURE / FUNCTION / EVENT statement
open the .sql backup .
Find and replace all the instances of your old URL with your new URL. 
For instance if your blog address is at http://example.com/wordpress/, and your files 
on your computer are at /htdocs/wordpress/, replace it with http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/.
SAVE


2) open C9 and create new wordpress template

3) (not required?) edit wp-congif to reflect backuped database login ???????? 
in c9 terminal make sure sql is installed -> 
mysql-ctl install
Then install phpMyAdmin:
phpmyadmin-ctl install ->here you get the login and url for phpmyadmin eg: https://dev1-tolkadot.c9users.io/phpmyadmin
After the installation is complete you'll just want to make sure mysql is running once more:
mysql-ctl start


4) open phpmyadmin c9 
slelect the c9 databse and import the backed up.sql files you just edited.

stop and start sql 

5) https://dev1-tolkadot.c9users.io/wp-admin/
and use the login/password for the original install to login 

6) make  ftp dir on c9 server
from ftp dir ftp to the live server and get the root directory
(Can't get cmd line access to ftp the live server so need to use a client - fto to local machine and transfer up to c9)
