Migrating from c9.io to a live site

1) install wordpress on live server
2) create a database user for the migration
3) go to C9.io and backup the database and files to local machine
**************************************************************************
using phpmyadmin -export database
Under databases tab -> select the database 
select the export tab 
custom - >tables - >select all
Add DROP TABLE / VIEW / PROCEDURE / FUNCTION / EVENT statement -> GO

an alternative to the next step (editing the .sql backup) is to go ahead and import the database then alter the required fields using PHPADMIN
Under the field options_name, you need to look for siteurl. Click the Edit Field icon which can be found at the far left at the beginning of the row.
When you click the edit field, an edit field window will appear. In the input box for option_value, you will see the URL of your local install probably something like: http://localhost/test. Carefully insert your new site url in this field, for example: http://www.wpbeginner.com
Save the field by clicking the Go button.
Next, you need to replicate this step for the option name: home. The wp_options page can be a few pages long, so simply find the home tab. Usually it is on the second page which you can navigate to by clicking on the pagination arrows in phpMyAdmin.
Update the home url to be the same as your siteurl.

I had a heap of trouble when migrating a c9 database to a live site as the siteurl for c9 was a https:// and the new one was a http://www.

OR OR OR OR OR 
.. open the .sql backup .
 .. Find and replace all the instances of your old URL with your new URL. (Global find/replace)
 .. For instance if your blog address is at http://example.com/wordpress/, and your files 
 .. on your computer are at /htdocs/wordpress/, replace it with http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/.

(the below can be prevented if you untick the 'create if not exists' while doing the db export
*I also had to remove the following line from the .sql file to prevent the import from failing
-- Database: `c9`
--
/*CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `c9` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
USE `c9`;*/

SAVE
**************************************************************************

4) upload/import c9.io database to the live database.
**************************************************************************
Open PHPMYADMIN on the live server


Change the wp-config.php file if required to reflect the new db user.password.
