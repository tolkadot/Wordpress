create folder inside theme folder called myGallery
copy in the /files to myGallery


** NOTE THAT IF YOU ARE USING A CHILD THEME YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE ALL THE PATHS **
EG  -> '../../18-tags-child/myGallery/gallery_header_include.php'
add a link to the css files (lightbox.css and gallery.css
paste- > <?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . '/myGallery/gallery_header_include.php'); ?>
to the header.php just before the </head>

register & enque scripts
paste contents of register-javascripts.txt into the gallery-functions-include.php

paste the following into functions.php to include the javascript that we just registered
<?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . '/myGallery/gallery_functions_include.php'); ?>

At this point check that the lighbox & gallery .css and .js files are being loaded into the head of the webpage

Also - > check that gallery.js is loading properly by writing a simple jQuery alert 

Style the galery in gallery.css -> add some padding or change the size of the images

Add the lightbox functionality to gallery.js -> 

jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    
 //alert("script is working");
    
    jQuery('.gallery a').each(function(){
        
         jQuery(this).attr('data-lightbox', 'slideshow');
        
    });
    
    
});
